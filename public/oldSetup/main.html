          <h3>Homelessness</h3>
            Despite the state's efforts in providing housing, homelessness continues to rise in Hawaii.  According to the Department of Urban Development, Hawaii has the highest rate of homelessness per capita in the United States. Homelessness is a complex issue with multiple causes. Sam strongly believes that housing is a  key priority.   He has personally been working with the homeless community for 24 years. As a small business owner Sam housed homeless individuals in his florist, allowing them to spend the night in the florist after business hours.  As a community member he befriended and supported homeless individuals, welcoming them into his life.
            Following the City's lead in theHousing First Initiative, Sam is coordinating a comprehensive pilot project.  The Hugh Street Housing project is located in Pearl City and will house 20+ modular houses for homeless or at-risk families.
            This site is currently undergoing environmental review. If it is approved, City and County will fund construction costs. The operation and maintenance will be provided through a public-private partnership.
            Sam hopes this project will be a model for a systematic cooperative to plan and build, streamlining present practices.  This would be the first of multiple projects to house  homeless and at-risk  individuals and families in Hawaii.
