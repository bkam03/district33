    <p id="aboutText">Sam Satoru Kong currently serves in the Hawaii House of Representatives representing District 33 (Aiea, Halawa, Newtown,
      Royal Summit, Waimalu). He was first elected into the House of Representatives in 2014. Sam won both his elections
      without fundraising or accepting any major donations. In 2014, he raised only $74 and in 2016, he raised zero!
      </br>
      </br>Sam was born on the island of Oahu and grew up in Kaimuki with the great Israel Kamakawiwo'ole or "Iz." In 2004, Sam
      and his family moved to Aiea and has been part of its community since! Sam is a proud veteran of the United States
      Airforce, where he served for ten years. After leaving the military, he became a computer technician for Servco and
      Software Plus respectively, but left in 1992 to start his own florist company, Aiea Florist. A relatively new business
      owner, he joined the Pearl City/Aiea Business Association where he became a founding member of the Aiea/Pearl City
      Graffiti Busters. This was the beginning of his volunteerism in the Aiea Community. For the next twenty years, Sam
      served on Gus Webling Elementary School's Council and later became a founding member of "Lions on the Move," a volunteer
      group dedicated to keeping our communities clean and beautiful. From graffiti painting and landscaping, to just picking
      up trash the Lions have done so much that you may have not even noticed. In addition to his volunteer work, Sam has
      been involved with the homeless in our State. </br>
      </br>During his tenure as a Representative, he has fought for less taxes, spending accountability, and more support for
      our students, teachers, and schools. In addition, he continues to advocate for more affordable housing for homeless
      families. Sam is committed to working with the people of Aiea to create viable solutions for our everyday struggles
      and he gladly offers his time to anyone 24/7!</p>
