  <p>After leaving the world of electronics and computers behind 25 years ago, I became the owner/operator of Aiea Florist.
    Being new to this, I joined the Aiea/ Pearl City Business Association. Later I became a founding member of the Aiea/Pearl
    City graffiti busters. That was the beginning of my volunteerism in the Aiea Community.</p>
